#You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way #is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
#
#Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
#
#`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`
#
#Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the #necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
#
#Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
#
#{% highlight ruby %}
#def print_hi(name)
#  puts "Hi, #{name}"
#end
#print_hi('Tom')
##=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
#{% endhighlight %}

This is it!

At last i took the time to read about the documentation of github pages and jekyll.
So this is my blog reborn.
I'll try to be more regular than during the previous year.
I do have a lot of things to share so it should be work.
In advance, thanks for reading me
