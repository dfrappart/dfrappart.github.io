Hello there, my name is David and i'm an IT guy.
Some people may also call me a nerd from time to time but this is highly exagerated ^^

A few years ago, i decided to move from a wordpress blog to something else.
That's it. This something else is github pages and a little of jekyll.
Apart from that, this blog aims to share with the world my experiences on the Cloud and secpifically on Azure.
I hope you'll enjoy it ^^
