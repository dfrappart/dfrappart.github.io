Hi all!

This is the 2nd article about Azure Virtual WAN. 
This time we're going to look at the Secure Hub concepts, what it is about and what it brings to the table.
As for last time, we'll take a pragmatic approach and build our environment iteratively to illustrate the concepts.

Hope you'll enjoy it
