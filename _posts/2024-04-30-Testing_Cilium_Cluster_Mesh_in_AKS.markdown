Hi there!

Last time, we discussed a bit about Cilium in an AKS environment.
But we let it at a point on which, well, we are far from having a complete picture. So in this article, I propose that we have a look at Cilium cluste rMesh featuer and see how it works and what it brings.

Our agenda will be as follow

1. Cluster Mesh concepts
2. Preparing the lab
3. Testing cluster mesh

Let's get started!

## 1. Cluster Mesh concepts




## 2. Preparing the lab
