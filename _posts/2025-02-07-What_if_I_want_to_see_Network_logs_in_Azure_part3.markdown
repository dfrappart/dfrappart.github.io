Hello everyone!

Last year, I published articles about getting logs on Azure Network. Ialways planned to follow up with a 3rd part for Azure Firewall logs.
This is it, 1 year later 

In [part1](/_posts/2024-02-10-What_if_I_want_to_see_Network_logs_in_Azure_part1.markdown), we review some basics and start playing with NSG diagnostics logs.

In [part2](), we add a look at the NSG flow logs and some visual rendering with dashboards and workbooks.

This time we'll focus on Azure Firewall logs, looking to the diagnostic settings categories, which queries could be useful and what we can do in terms of visualization.

Let's get started!
  
## 1. Azure Firewall logs categories




## 2. Querying Azure Firewall logs




## 3. What about some dashboard?


### 3.1. Azure dashboard




### 3.2. Azure workbook



Ok time to wrap this up!

## 4. Wrapping it up
