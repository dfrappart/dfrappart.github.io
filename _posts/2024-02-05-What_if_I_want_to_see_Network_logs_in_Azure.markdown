Hello everyone!

in this article, I propose a journey in the Azure Network observability.
After choosing what to do in terms of Azure Network topology, at one point, we have to cnsider operations, which means we need to see which flows go through which firewalls.
As most people using Azure probably know, those firewalls can take different forms and the associated visibility will depends of the firewall nature.
So, we will start by a rapid review of the possiblility for the Network filtering in Azure and  we will have a look at the different logs (because visibility is almost always related to logs) available for the Azure Network service through different scenarios.

Let's get started!
  
## 1. Review of Azure Network filtering options


## 2. Getting visibility for flows going through NSGs

## 3. Getting visibility for flows going through an Azure Firewall

## 4. Wrapping it up
